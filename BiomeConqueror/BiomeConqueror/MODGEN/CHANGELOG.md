### CHANGELOG

## 1.0.0

Initial version:

* After defeating Bonemass, you will no longer get wet with the swamp rain (you will in other biomes).
* After defeating Moder, you will no longer get frozen in mountains when no wearing freezing protection effects.
* After defeating The Queen, the wisp light belt will have the range increased long enough to see your surroundings.
